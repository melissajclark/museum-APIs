# Museum APIs

This project is under development, by myself, [Melissa Jean Clark](http://melissajclark.ca). 

Inspired by the [Rijks Museum](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en)'s API, I am building a website that will allow you to search across multiple museum's collections.

## Notes & Features to Add

### Notes

- Ultimately I want to include several museum's APIs so users can search across multiple collections. 
- For now, I am focusing on getting the initial prototype functioning (and looking) well
- The initial prototype only includes artworks from the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam

### Features to Implement (in order of priority)

- [x] expandable "read more" section around image metadata
- [x] button for user to load more items (only appending a few artworks at a time to reduce initial loading time)
- [x] append date of artwork
- [x] lightbox / gallery feature for users to view images larger
- [x] filtering options (ie. narrow down first results by data such as medium, maker, location, etc)
- [x] sorting options (ie. give user option to sort results alphabetically by maker, chronologically, etc)
- [ ] random search option?
- [ ] filtrify: hide items with a value of 0 when user filters (ie. if user filters view to only see 1900 and that excludes paintings, don't show 0 paintings in filters)
- [ ] add message if nothing is found
